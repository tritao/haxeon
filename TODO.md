# Haxeon follow-ups

Concrete gaps found while compiling Materia. Longer-term direction is in
`ROADMAP.md`.

- **Enum abstracts lose their type when lowered.**
  `DeclarationIndex.resolveNamedType` resolves an enum abstract to its
  underlying type, so a switch subject or expected type of an enum abstract
  is just `Int`/`String`, and a bare case value such as `case Box:` cannot be
  resolved against the switched type as Haxe does. `BodyTyper` works around
  it by searching every enum abstract for the value, preferring the one in the
  current package (`722504a6`, test
  `tests/compiler/SamePackageEnumAbstractValueMain.hx`). A switch over an
  enum abstract from another package still fails when two imported abstracts
  share a value name. Keep enum abstracts as `TAbstract`, like other
  abstracts, and resolve bare values from the expected type; then remove the
  package heuristic.
- **`Type.getClassName` and `Type.getClass` are missing** from the standard
  library (`E1007: Unknown function "Type.getClassName"`).
