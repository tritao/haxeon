# UI value types

This implements the value conversions in stage 0 of [ADR 0002](../../../docs/adr/0002-reactive-ui-model.md); including typed style storage and transitions.

`Rect`, `Insets`, `Color`, `LayoutAxis` and `Transform2D` are immutable `Hashable` structs. Their fields are final;
replace the whole value to change one. Their `==` and `!=` comparisons use the declared conformance. Optional values use `Null<T>`,
including inline optional fields; absent and present remain distinct. `LayoutStyle` owns these values inline in one
object, and `Hashable` style fingerprints still cover their fields.

The native layout interface uses an output buffer for resolved geometry. The session reuses that buffer and holds on to
immutable results when their fields have not changed. This keeps the C ABI explicit and avoids rebuilding geometry that
is already available. The other values continue to cross the native boundary through the existing scalar encoder.

Inlining values enlarges their holders. The conversion also removes unnecessary repeated holder creation: retained
docking panes and clean inspector alternatives reuse their trees, and property controls reuse private style templates.
The inspector cache is bounded, and changed transient editor state is discarded on a selection change as before.
Retained alternatives have separate state scopes, validate dependencies and topology, and rearm their self-updating
children before reuse. Verification continues to compare retained trees to fresh builds.

Declarations, computed styles and transitions retain their known value kinds. Computed styles share immutable typed
declarations until modified, and typed equality and interpolation keep structs out of Dynamic. Inspection, dumps and
reflection materialize dynamic values when requested. This replaces the temporary inline-axis and cached snapshot
boxing paths. The textual tree dump skips unused inspection entries and rule provenance while preserving copy hooks and
their failures; public inspection snapshots still expose values to reflection.

Struct boxes can still occur at real dynamic and reflective boundaries. For example, inspecting a dynamic style value
materializes a box; a type census should distinguish `@`-prefixed struct boxes from the former class allocations. The
compiler scalarizes supported direct and typed calls, optional locals and inline field copies; unsupported or escaping
values retain the normal boxed ABI. See [STRUCTS.md](../../../docs/STRUCTS.md) for the calling conventions and attribution.
The same-machine 30-cycle HashLink census starts after the initial editor frame and includes scenario setup. It counts
allocations by type. Entries after conversion are
struct boxes (`@haxeon.ui.*`) if a dynamic boundary is exercised. The per-action KiB and Wasm GC Showcase comparisons are in
[STRUCTS.md](../../../docs/STRUCTS.md).

The Wasm GC Showcase counts in that comparison instrument generated `struct.new` and `array.new` operations. The compiler
flag `--wasm-gc-allocation-count` and CMake option `NKUI_HAXEON_WASM_GC_ALLOCATION_COUNT` are disabled by default; with
the option off, the guest has no counter global, instructions or export. The benchmark wrapper enables the option when
it rebuilds a Wasm GC artifact and reports `memory.wasm_gc_objects` and `memory.wasm_gc_objects_per_frame` for measured
frames after warmup. From `packages/ui`, rebuild and collect the 120-frame comparison in one command:

```sh
NKUI_HAXEON_TARGET=wasm-gc NATIVEKIT_WEB_BENCHMARK_BUILD=1 \
NATIVEKIT_WEB_BENCHMARK_WARMUP=120 NATIVEKIT_WEB_BENCHMARK_FRAMES=120 \
./tools/benchmark-web-haxeon.sh
```

The wrapper also supplies NativeKit's `web_smoke` helper path to Python. To build the instrumented Showcase guest without
running a benchmark, use `NKUI_HAXEON_TARGET=wasm-gc NKUI_HAXEON_WASM_GC_ALLOCATION_COUNT=ON ./tools/build-web.sh`.
